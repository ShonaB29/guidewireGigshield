## Deliverables Showcase

The executable source code demonstrates the following key features:

### 1. Registration Process
- **Mobile-Friendly Signup**: Minimal inputs (name, email, password, role) with location auto-detection.
- **Onboarding**: Captures worker profile, location, and risk factors for personalized policies.
- **Screens**: `SignupScreen` in Flutter app, backend `/signup` and `/onboarding` APIs.

### 2. Insurance Policy Management
- **Policy Details**: Clear display of coverage conditions, active policies, premium, and coverage amount.
- **Management UI**: Dashboard cards showing policy status, weekly premium, and coverage.
- **Screens**: `PolicyDetailsScreen`, dashboard policy cards in Flutter app.

### 3. Dynamic Premium Calculation
- **AI Integration**: Machine Learning model adjusts weekly premiums based on hyper-local risk factors.
  - Reduces premium by ₹2/week for zones historically safe from water logging.
  - Offers increased coverage hours based on predictive weather modeling.
- **Model**: RandomForestRegressor trained on rainfall, AQI, traffic, zone type, and historical disruptions.
- **API**: `/calculate-premium` endpoint computes dynamic pricing with explanations.
- **UI**: Premium adjustment reasons displayed in dashboard (e.g., "Premium reduced due to low-risk zone").

### 4. Claims Management
- **Zero-Touch Claim Process**: Automated claim initiation when triggers are met, validation using real-time/mock data, status updates without manual input.
- **Seamless UX**: Trigger → Auto Claim → Processing → Completed → Payout (simulated).
- **Screens**: `ClaimsHistoryScreen`, claim simulation, dashboard claim buttons.
- **API**: `/create-claim`, `/auto-trigger` for automated workflows.

### Additional Features
- **Automated Triggers**: 3-5 triggers using public/mock APIs:
  - Heavy rain/extreme weather (OpenWeather API).
  - Air pollution levels (AQI mock).
  - Traffic disruptions (mock data).
  - When triggered, automatically activate coverage and log events.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: SnackBar alerts (e.g., "Rain detected – coverage activated").
- **Weather Forecast**: 24-hour forecast showing temperature, humidity, rain probability, and weather descriptions for better worker planning.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Analytics for users, claims, premiums, and trends.

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flutter SDK
- Node.js 16+
- Android/iOS emulator or device for mobile app

### Backend (Flask API)
```bash
cd demo_app-main/gigcover-ai/backend
python app.py
```
Runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000

### Frontend (React Web)
```bash
cd demo_app-main/gigcover-ai/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Runs on http://localhost:5173 (or next available port)

### Mobile App (Flutter)
```bash
cd demo_app-main/gigcover_mobile
flutter pub get
flutter run --debug
```
Requires connected emulator/device.

### Demo Flow
1. **Registration**: Signup in mobile app, complete onboarding.
2. **Policy**: View policy details and dynamic premium.
3. **Triggers**: Use "Check for Triggers" in dashboard to simulate automated triggers.
4. **Claims**: Auto-claims process with status updates.
5. **Payout**: Simulated payout in claims history.

This section addresses the Market Crash scenario: coordinated fraud using fake GPS, synchronized claims, and payout abuse.

### Goal

Detect fraudulent location-based claims quickly while protecting genuine stranded workers from false rejection.

### Threat Model

1. Fake GPS injection (mock location apps, emulator routes)
2. GPS teleporting (impossible jumps in short time)
3. Collusive rings (many users filing similar claims from clustered synthetic traces)
4. Device farming (many accounts from few devices or network fingerprints)
5. Timing attacks (claims filed immediately after scripted location updates)

### Defense Strategy (Logic-Only)

1. Multi-signal trust scoring instead of single GPS pass/fail
2. Progressive verification based on risk tier
3. Ring-level anomaly detection in addition to user-level checks
4. Human review fallback for ambiguous cases
5. Strong audit trail for every approval and rejection

### Anti-Spoofing Signals Used

1. Location trajectory consistency:
  - Speed and acceleration plausibility
  - Route continuity and drift patterns
  - Teleport detection between pings
2. Sensor coherence:
  - GPS movement vs device motion behavior
  - Foreground activity consistency during claim window
3. Device and session integrity:
  - Reused device identifiers across multiple accounts
  - Suspicious account creation and claim velocity
4. Network and geo context:
  - Repeated claim clusters from shared network fingerprints
  - Distance mismatch between claimed disruption zone and recent path
5. Temporal behavior:
  - Script-like timing (identical intervals, synchronized submissions)
  - Burst claims around payout windows

### Fraud Ring Detection

1. Build graph edges between accounts using shared signals:
  - Device overlap
  - IP/network overlap
  - Reused route signatures
  - Same disruption-time claim bursts
2. Identify dense suspicious communities with high internal similarity and low historical legitimacy
3. Escalate whole cluster to higher scrutiny, not just individual nodes

### Decision Engine

1. Low risk score:
  - Auto-approve if policy and weather/disruption context align
2. Medium risk score:
  - Delay payout briefly and request lightweight re-verification
3. High risk score:
  - Block instant payout
  - Trigger manual review and ring investigation

### False-Positive Protection (Do Not Punish Honest Workers)

1. No permanent penalty from a single suspicious event
2. Appeal flow with secondary evidence acceptance
3. Grace threshold for noisy GPS environments
4. Favor partial hold over hard denial when confidence is uncertain
5. Explainable reason tags for each decision

### Operational Response During Market Crash

1. Activate emergency risk mode (higher sensitivity for coordinated attacks)
2. Shorten fraud monitoring intervals
3. Increase manual audit sampling for high-payout claims
4. Freeze only suspicious clusters, not entire geography
5. Publish transparent status updates to maintain worker trust

### Metrics to Track

1. Fraud capture rate
2. False positive rate
3. Mean time to detect ring behavior
4. Mean time to release valid payouts
5. Loss prevented vs delayed genuine payouts

### Why This Works

1. Attackers can spoof one signal, but not many coherent signals over time
2. Ring analytics catches coordinated abuse that per-user checks miss
3. Tiered decisions preserve platform liquidity while protecting genuine workers

## Render Deployment Guide

### 1. Push Code

Push the gigcover-ai project to your GitHub repository.

### 2. Create Render Web Service

1. Open Render dashboard
2. Create New -> Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Use render.yaml or configure manually:
  - Build command: pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Start command: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
5. If manual setup is used, set Root Directory = backend

### 3. Environment Variables on Render

1. JWT_SECRET
2. OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
3. CORS_ORIGINS=*
4. DB_PATH=/var/data/gigcover.db

### 4. Add Persistent Disk

Attach Render Disk and mount at /var/data.

### 5. Health Check

Open:

https://your-app.onrender.com/

Expected response:

```json
{
  "service": "GigCover AI backend",
  "status": "ok"
}
```
